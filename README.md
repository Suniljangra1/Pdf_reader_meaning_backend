# Pdf_reader_meaning_backend
Reading digital documents like PDFs or Word files can be slow and distracting when encountering unfamiliar words. Users often have to switch to Google repeatedly to find meanings, which:

Breaks reading flow

Wastes time

Reduces focus and comprehension

Solution

Smart Document Reader solves this by allowing users to upload PDF or Word (.docx) files and automatically detect difficult words.

Words are highlighted directly in the document

Hovering or tapping on a word shows:

Meaning

Example usage

Users can read seamlessly without leaving the document, saving time and improving focus

Features

Automatic detection of difficult words

Hover/tap to view meanings and examples

Faster, distraction-free reading

If you want, I can now expand this into a full professional GitHub README with Installation, Usage, Screenshots, and Future Scope sections. It will look ready for publishing.
